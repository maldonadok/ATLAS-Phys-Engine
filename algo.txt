Writing out a simple rough draft of an algorith to explore.

Goal - predict where things end up.

Given the PHYSLITE data, we have the trajectories of what goes on during particle collision.
In each event object, we have essentially all readings at that particular slice of time,
namely transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azithumal momemntum respective to the transverse plane.

Take a look at each event, look at the event after it in time, calculate deltas, plot deltas.
Do the deltas for deltas

Then, given an arbitrary event, we should take the most likely delta to happen and apply it.
Repeat this for this arbitrary event until something either cool or dumb happens. Likely nothing.

-------------
Next task: validate event object --> depth_limit=1, see documentation online.
